Nock Balance Monitor
A Go program that monitors blockchain address balances on the Nockblocks network, converts balances from nick to $NOCK (2^16 nick = 65,536 nick per $NOCK), and sends formatted notifications to a Slack channel. It checks balances every minute, sends alerts on changes, and provides a summary every 6 hours. Balances are stored locally in balances.json for comparison.
Features

Balance Monitoring: Queries balances for multiple addresses every minute via the Nockblocks RPC API (https://nockblocks.com/rpc).
Slack Notifications: Sends beautifully formatted alerts for balance changes and periodic summaries using Slack's block kit.
Balance Conversion: Converts balances from nick to $NOCK (1 $NOCK = 65,536 nick).
Local Storage: Persists balances in balances.json to track changes across runs.
Multi-Address Support: Monitors multiple addresses configured in the .env file.
Scheduling: Uses gocron for reliable minute-by-minute checks and 6-hourly summaries.

Prerequisites

Go: Version 1.16 or higher.
Slack Workspace: Access to a Slack workspace where you can create an app and add it to a channel.
Dependencies:
github.com/go-co-op/gocron
github.com/joho/godotenv
github.com/slack-go/slack



Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required Go packages:
go get github.com/go-co-op/gocron
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
go get github.com/slack-go/slack

2. Create a Slack App

Go to Slack API and click "Create New App" > "From scratch."
Name the app (e.g., NockBalanceBot) and select your workspace.
Under OAuth & Permissions > Bot Token Scopes, add:
chat:write (to send messages).


Install the app to your workspace to generate a Bot User OAuth Token (starts with xoxb-).
Copy the token for use in the .env file.

3. Add the Bot to a Slack Channel

Create or choose a Slack channel (e.g., #nock-balances).
Add the bot:
In the channel, type /invite @NockBalanceBot or go to channel settings > "Integrations" > "Add an App" and select your bot.


Ensure the bot has permission to post messages (granted via chat:write scope).

4. Configure the Environment
Create a .env file in the project root with the following:
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CHANNEL=#nock-balances
ADDRESSES=3c2fmFYwe1cfMdAoPY3gbiLcLuWbFZzqnkbHu7zLHdJCTVJHXkZSJyBWMBQiQkbmvzH7f5zrLJh8YNn2bBVa1R54zEMk5LL52d1UiwHzHUdbkVMkajvZSo5DRWkjQcPnh6Nq,another_address_here


Replace xoxb-your-bot-token with the Slack bot token.
Replace #nock-balances with your channel name.
Add multiple addresses in ADDRESSES, separated by commas.

5. Run the Program
go run main.go

The program will:

Check balances every minute.
Send Slack alerts for balance changes.
Send a summary every 6 hours.
Store balances in balances.json.

Balance Conversion
Balances are reported in both nick and $NOCK:

1 $NOCK = 2^16 nick = 65,536 nick.
Example: 34492645376 nick = 526.18 $NOCK.

Troubleshooting

Bot Not Posting:
Verify SLACK_BOT_TOKEN is correct (starts with xoxb-) and has chat:write scope.
Ensure the bot is added to the channel (/invite @NockBalanceBot).
Check SLACK_CHANNEL matches the channel name (e.g., #nock-balances).
Review logs for errors (e.g., Error sending Slack message: ...).


Network Issues:
Ensure access to https://nockblocks.com/rpc and https://slack.com/api.


Invalid Addresses:
Verify addresses in ADDRESSES are valid and correctly formatted.


Program Stops:
For 24/7 operation, deploy on a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).



Deployment
For production:

Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2, Heroku).
Use a process manager like systemd or pm2 to keep the program running.
Monitor logs for errors and ensure network connectivity.

Security

Keep SLACK_BOT_TOKEN secure. Regenerate it in the Slack API portal if compromised.
Store the .env file outside version control (add to .gitignore).
